# Azure-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project

## Adventure Works

Worked on End-to-End Azure Data Engineering project from scratch where I leverage powerful technologies like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark, along with managed identities, API connections, and many more.

**What I learnt:**

•	How to design and implement a robust data pipeline using Azure Data Factory. 
•	The process of data integration and transformation with Databricks. 
•	Utilizing Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient data warehousing and analytics. 
•	Best practices for handling big data solutions and real-time data processing with Apache Spark.

We used Medallion Architecture (Layers), it’s a kind of approach we followed in data engineering solutions.  We make our data to travel into three different zones bronze (raw Data), silver (Transformed), and gold (Serving layer).

**About Dataset (Why I pick this Dataset?)**

This data is available on Kaggle, it was full of tables, and this gives you an advantage when you showcase your project that involved so many tables, because they know that this person has applied so many Joins, Lookups while completing this project. This dataset was past three years of sales data 2015, 2016, 2017. Adventure Works is an ideal data set if you want to work with end-to-end solution because we can perform so many joins, transformations, and we can do a lot more with these tables. That’s why I picked this dataset. In this dataset we have (2 Fact tables (Sales, returns), and 6-dimension tables)
