# Azure-End-To-End-Data-Engineering-Project

## Adventure Works

Worked on End-to-End Azure Data Engineering project from scratch where I leverage powerful technologies like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark, along with managed identities, API connections, and many more.

**What I learnt:**
•	How to design and implement a robust data pipeline using Azure Data Factory. 
•	The process of data integration and transformation with Databricks. 
•	Utilizing Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient data warehousing and analytics. 
•	Best practices for handling big data solutions and real-time data processing with Apache Spark.

We used Medallion Architecture (Layers), it’s a kind of approach we followed in data engineering solutions.  We make our data to travel into three different zones bronze (raw Data), silver (Transformed), and gold (Serving layer).
